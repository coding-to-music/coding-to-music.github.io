  <li>This site is full of opinion. We have collected a huge wide variety of items and we attempt to label these items as either True or False.   </li>
  <li>We document why it is our opinion, our group consensus, that these items are correctly tagged as either True or False.  </li>
  <li>Every item will be able to be tagged so you can either agree or disagree by you tagging the item yourself.   </li>
  <li>That feature is not yet ready but you can see we are attempting to make this a community-driven collective-knowledge resource.  </li>

<h2> WHO official urges world leaders to stop using lockdowns as primary virus control method   </h2> 
<ul>
  <li>The World Health Organization’s special envoy on COVID-19 urged world leaders this week to stop “using lockdowns as your primary control method.”</li>  
  <li>“We in the World Health Organization do not advocate lockdowns as the primary means of control of this virus,” Dr. David Nabarro said to The Spectator’s Andrew Neil. </li>  
  <li>“The only time we believe a lockdown is justified is to buy you time to reorganize, regroup, rebalance your resources, protect your health workers who are exhausted, but by and large, we’d rather not do it.”</li>  
</ul>

<h2> The WHO is recommending key changes to PCR testing.    </h2>

The WHO is recommending some changes to PCR testing.    

"PCR positive" is no longer a Covid "case"      

You are not Covid "case" now unless you get a second test to confirm it, and are presenting clinical symptoms.  
WHO guidance Diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2 states that careful interpretation of weak positive results is needed (1). The cycle threshold (Ct) needed to detect virus is inversely proportional to the patient’s viral load. Where test results do not correspond with the clinical presentation, a new specimen should be taken and retested using the same or different NAT technology.  

WHO reminds IVD users that **disease prevalence alters the predictive value of test results**; *as disease prevalence decreases, the risk of false positive increases (2). This means that the probability that a person who has a positive result (SARS-CoV-2 detected) is truly infected with SARS-CoV-2 decreases as prevalence decreases, irrespective of the claimed specificity.*

Cheap hair lice drug may cut the risk of hospitalised Covid patients dying by up to 80%, study finds  
Ivermectin - which can cost as little as £1.50 per treatment- was also found to potentially halve the time those suffering from the virus were on the ward  
Ivermectin was discovered in the 1970s and has fast become an essential medicine for a vast number of parasitic infections, such as head lice and scabies.

It is branded as Stromectol, an oral tablet for scabies and Soolantra, a skin cream for rosacea. It is branded as Sklice for treating head lice, which was approved in the US this year. 

Today it is prescribed on the NHS and in the US for these conditions, but some scientists argue it could also be useful against Covid-19.

<h1> FAQ Frequently Asked Questions   </h1> 
<h2> What do we know?   </h2> 

<ul>
  <li>A virus has been reported.  The virus affects mainly old, infirm, and those with comorbidities - the people who typically die of the flu.</li>  
  <li>The virus also appears to affect PoC more severely  </li>  
</ul>

<h2> What do we not know?   </h2> 


<h2> What is issues with PCR testing and "cases"     </h2> 

<ul>
  <li>PCR "cases" indicates the presence of old inert remnants of inactive pieces of virus  </li>
    <li>The PCR test replicates, amplifies, multiplies the sample X times. 30-35 cyles is good, above will give lots of false postive "cases" - but they are false positive - if the PCR test was re-run at 28 or 30 it will likely be negative.  </li>
      <li>PCR testing has an interesting side effect in that the testing organization obtains your full DNA profile  </li>
</ul>

This is an excellent overview of the cases issue:
"Case rate fallacy/false positive paradox" is derived from Bayes theorem. When the incidence of a disease in a population is low, unless the test used has very high specificity, more false positives will be determined than true positives. The difference in the numbers can be quite striking and certainly not inherently understandable."

<h2> What would a multi-year chart of "Deaths by Cause and Age" show us and where is that data?   </h2> 

<ul>
  <li>The CDC last updated the data in 2018 - we have no data from 2019 or 2020 - no cause of death by age.</li>
  <li>This is important because how will we know when the vaccines are effective?</li>
  <li>Why is this simple data being withheld?</li>  
</ul>

<h2> What are some simple questions that we think do not make any sense </h2> 

<ul>
  <li>Old infirm w/ comorbidity are dying. So Why inject young healthy of reproductive age?  </li>
    <li>If the supermarket and many stores and business can be open, why not the library?  </li>  
</ul>

<h2> What items do we consider true, and why?   </h2> 

<ul>
  <li>It is completely unrealistic to believe a natural virus jumped out of a bush and caused this pandemic. This is a man-made virus.  </li>
</ul>

<h2> What items do we consider false, and why?   </h2> 

<ul>
  <li>The virus did not come from nature. It has too many advanced gain-of-function features that scientists recently proudly documented in published papers.  </li>  
</ul>

Love, Death and Robots
love-death-and-robots-zima-blueImage via Netflix
Created by: Tim Miller

Executive produced by Tim Miller (Deadpool) and legendary filmmaker David Fincher, the animated anthology series Love, Death & Robots is kind of the perfect catch-all for sci-fi fans. Each episode hails from a different writer and director, and the theme holding them all together is the idea of sci-fi technology. As a result you get a wide range of tone from uber-violent to romantic to hysterically funny. All in all, though, there’s just some really great sci-fi storytelling in here. – Adam Chitwood

  The
  [**<span style="font-size: 95%; font-family: quadplay">quadplay✜</span>**](../console/quadplay.html?IDE=1)
  is a web-based fantasy game console for sprite-based 2D and 2.5D
  games. It lets you create games with the power and consistency of a
  game console and the flexibility of modern tools and web deployment.
  

  **Virtual Hardware Features**

  - 384 x 224 pixel screen = 12:7 aspect ≈ 16:9.3
  - 60 fps, with autoscaling on low-end machines


  If you're new to programming, just look at the many sample games and
  examples that are included and try modifying your own copies of them.
  
  !!! Info Pro Developers
      Experienced programmers can use external editors with quadplay✜ for both
      programming and directly modifying game and asset `.json` files by:
      <ul>
        <li>Optionally [clone the SDK with git](https://github.com/morgan3d/quadplay) to manage SDK upgrades</li>
        <li>Install a code editor (_[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Atom](https://atom.io/), [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com), Vim, Emacs, etc._)</li>
        <li>Install the PyxlScript extension for your editor: _[Visual Studio Code](#advancedtools/visualstudiocode)_, _[Vim](#advancedTools/vim)_, _[Emacs](#advancedtools/emacs)_</li>
        <li>Put your games under `~/my_quadplay/`. The IDE always creates new games in the root of that path, but
            you can reorganize it to form a hierarchy to group games or manage different games
            using different version control repositories. </li>
      </ul>
  
  
  Launch your program in the emulator and debugger from the command line
  on Windows CMD, macOS Terminal, or a Linux terminal with the `quadplay`

  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ bash
  # Run the emulator and IDE. You can use Open Game from the Tools
  # menu to load games
  quadplay
  
  # Load the games/quadpaddle/quadpaddle.game.json sample program
  quadplay quad://games/quadpaddle
  
  # Load the space.game.json game that you've made (on Mac and Linux)
  quadplay ~/my_quadplay/space
  
  # Load the space.game.json game that you've made (on Windows)
  quadplay C:\Users\MYNAME\my_quadplay\space
  
  # Load your game and allow mobile clients to connect by scanning
  # the QR code displayed in the IDE (Mac and Linux)
  quadplay --serve ~/my_quadplay/space
  
  # ... Windows
  quadplay --serve C:\Users\MYNAME\my_quadplay\space
  
  # Load a game from the web (their server must support CORS)
  quadplay https://morgan3d.github.io/somegame/foo.game.json
