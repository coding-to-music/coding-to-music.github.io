Moderna has begun testing its COVID-19 vaccine on babies and young children, the drug company announced Tuesday.

A first group of kids received their initial shot of the vaccine through a two-phase clinical trial, dubbed the KidCOVE study, in which researchers intend to recruit nearly 6,800 children in the U.S. and Canada between 6 months and 11 years old.

An analysis of how the young patients respond to different dose amounts in the first phase will help create the proper dosage used in the second phase, which will also include a placebo.
