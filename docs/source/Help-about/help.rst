About Me
---------------------------------------------------

My name is Tom Connors, I was born in Boston in 1962, I am a member of a large Irish family in Boston, my kids are grown now, and I have all this time, now that I am on Pandemic Relief after working for decades as a software developer and project manager for Fidelity Investments and State Street Bank and Athena Healthcare, among others. I recieved my undergrad in Computer Science in 1993 from Northeastern University in Boston, and earned my MBA from Babson College in 2015. An active traveler and reader, seeking pastry and a good place to read and relax.

My current activites are creating and using content creation tools, using current cloud engineering building tools to create and operate a reliable content delivery pipeline, and being able to convey messages effectively.

I first used the internet in the 1980's, for example we used rec.music.gdead to trade Greatful Dead show tapes when I was working as a co-op student doing situational awareness mapping while working at MITRE.
