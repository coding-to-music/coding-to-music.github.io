A new COVID-19 outbreak has been declared at CHSLD Lionel-Émond in Gatineau, Que., where at least two dozen residents and staff have contracted the illness while waiting for their second vaccine doses.

On Monday, the region's health authority, Centre intégré de santé et des services sociaux de l'Outaouais (CISSSO), said 23 residents of the long-term care home near the Hull Hospital had tested positive. There are fewer than five cases among staff and further screening is ongoing, said the health unit in a news release.

"Several positive cases [were] reported in the last 24 hours," according to the news release. CISSSO said it's on the lookout for possible COVID-19 variants related to the outbreak.

Majority of cases asymptomatic
-------------------------------

According to CISSSO, nearly all those infected were vaccinated with an initial dose in December. Most of the latest cases are asymptomatic and were discovered only after scheduled screening, making it difficult to determine when or how the outbreak began, CISSSO said.

In the news release, CISSSO reassured family members that the majority of those confirmed cases are "doing well for the moment." 

Rapid testing will add to strain on long-term care sector, advocates warn

A CHSLD Lionel-Émond resident was the first person in western Quebec to get a COVID-19 vaccine in late December. Seventeen residents and two staff members at the home died during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.
