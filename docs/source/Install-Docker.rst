Install Docker Engine on Debian
--------------------------------------------------

Hello World Docker to validate correct setup 
--------------------------------------------------

Hello World Docker ::

    $ sudo docker run hello-world

    Hello from Docker!
    This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

    To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
    1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
    2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
        (amd64)
    3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
        executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
    4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
        to your terminal.

    To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
    $ docker run -it ubuntu bash
