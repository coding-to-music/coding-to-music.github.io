GitHub flow is a lightweight, branch-based workflow that supports teams and projects where deployments are made regularly  
  
This guide explains how and why the GitHub workflow works.  
  

- Main is deployable always  
- Create a branch & Commit work on it  
- Pull Request announces your work and opens discussion, even if you are nowhere near being ready to complete it
- Discussions are in the activity, full markup capability  
- @mentions to alert others  
- a bot can do housekeeping tasks such as trim old dead stale branches  
- Discuss and review changes, ensure testing and style are adhered to  
- Deploy to pre-prod or prod  
- Merge with main branch
