In 1972, Supreme Court Justice White, while giving the opinion of the Court in

Stanley v. Illinois, 405 U.S. 645 (1972) stated:

"It is cardinal with us that the custody, care and nurture of the child reside first in the parents, whose primary function and freedom include preparation for obligations the state can neither supply nor hinder."

These rights to provide for the well being of your children are afforded under the 14th ammendment which states:

"The liberty of parents to direct the upbringing, education, and care of their children is a fundamental right.

Is time to remind our legislators of our rights.
