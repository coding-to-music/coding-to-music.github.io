Specific Admonitions
====================


Admonitions are specially marked "topics" that can appear anywhere an
ordinary body element can.  They contain arbitrary body elements.
Typically, an admonition is rendered as an offset block in a document,
sometimes outlined or shaded, with a title matching the admonition
type.  For example::

    .. DANGER::
       Beware killer rabbits!

This directive might be rendered something like this::

    +------------------------+
    |        !DANGER!        |
    |                        |
    | Beware killer rabbits! |
    +------------------------+

.. DANGER::
    Beware killer rabbits!



The following admonition directives have been implemented:

- attention
- caution
- danger
- error
- hint
- important
- note
- tip
- warning

Any text immediately following the directive indicator (on the same
line and/or indented on following lines) is interpreted as a directive
block and is parsed for normal body elements.  For example, the
following "note" admonition directive contains one paragraph and a
bullet list consisting of two list items::

    .. note:: This is a note admonition.
       This is the second line of the first paragraph.

       - The note contains all indented body elements
         following.
       - It includes this bullet list.


.. note:: This is a note admonition.
    This is the second line of the first paragraph.

    - The note contains all indented body elements
        following.
    - It includes this bullet list.


Generic Admonition
==================

:Directive Type: "admonition"
:Doctree Elements: admonition_, title
:Directive Arguments: One, required (admonition title)
:Directive Options: Possible, see below.
:Directive Content: Interpreted as body elements.

This is a generic, titled admonition.  The title may be anything the
author desires.

The author-supplied title is also used as a `"classes"`_ attribute value
after being converted into a valid identifier form (down-cased;
non-alphanumeric characters converted to single hyphens; "admonition-"
prefixed).  For example, this admonition::

    .. admonition:: And, by the way...

       You can make up your own admonition too.

.. admonition:: And, by the way...

    You can make up your own admonition too.

becomes the following document tree (pseudo-XML)::

    <document source="test data">
        <admonition classes="admonition-and-by-the-way">
            <title>
                And, by the way...
            <paragraph>
                You can make up your own admonition too.

The `common options`_ are recognized:

``class`` : text
    Overrides the computed `"classes"`_ attribute value.

``name`` : text
  Add `text` to the `"names"`_ attribute of the admonition element.




--------------
Common Options
--------------

Most of the directives that generate doctree elements support the following
options:

.. _class-option:

_`:class:` : text
    Set a `"classes"`_ attribute value on the doctree element generated by
    the directive. See also the class_ directive.

_`:name:` : text
    Add `text` to the `"names"`_ attribute of the doctree element generated
    by the directive. This allows `hyperlink references`_ to the element
    using `text` as `reference name`_.

    Specifying the `name` option of a directive, e.g., ::

      .. image:: bild.png
         :name: my picture

    is a concise syntax alternative to preceding it with a `hyperlink
    target`_ ::

      .. _my picture:

      .. image:: bild.png
