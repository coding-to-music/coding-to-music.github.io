Many Python projects use Sphinx for documentation, so much so that Sphinx is like Python’s secret weapon. It’s a powerful, mature system for generating static content -- not just docs, but blogs and regular websites.

Sphinx can also be customized and extended in various ways, and here the trip gets wild and wooly. With such a venerable software stack, Sphinx can be inscrutable when you paint outside the lines.

This talk gives Sphinx civilians confidence to go beyond simply using Sphinx, towards adapting Sphinx to their needs: configuration values, local CSS and templates, installing extensions and themes, writing a small extension with a directive, and testing that extension. We’ll conclude with a roundup of challenges and benefits that come with diving into Sphinx.

As the talk provides shallow treatment of a wide topic list, follow-up and hands-on instruction will be given at an open space.


Jinja
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Jinja is a fast, expressive, extensible templating engine. Special placeholders in the template allow writing code similar to Python syntax. Then the template is passed data to render the final document.

Jinja2 is a full-featured template engine for Python. It has full unicode support, an optional integrated sandboxed execution environment, widely used and BSD licensed.

Jinja2 is one of the most used template engines for Python. It is inspired by Django's templating system but extends it with an expressive language that gives template authors a more powerful set of tools. On top of that it adds sandboxed execution and optional automatic escaping for applications where security is important.
