Do I need to install pip?

https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/

pip is already installed if you are using Python 2 >=2.7.9 or Python 3 >=3.4 downloaded from python.org or if you are working in a Virtual Environment created by virtualenv or venv. Just make sure to upgrade pip.

Use the following command to check whether pip is installed:


Unix/macOS
$ python -m pip --version
