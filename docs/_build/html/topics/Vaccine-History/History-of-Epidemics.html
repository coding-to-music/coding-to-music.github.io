<h1>History of Epidemics<a class="headerlink" href="#history-of-epidemics" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>If you want to understand C  O  V  I  D—the history of polio may offer important insights. Perhaps more than any other disease, polio has been used to promote the safety and efficacy of vaccines. The information disseminated about polio remains deeply ingrained in the public consciousness as absolute truth. However, the actual history of polio tells a far different, more sinister story.</p>
<p>Historical Timeline</p>
<p>1814: Emerald Green or Paris Green was a highly toxic pigment made with arsenic and verdigris. The bright green color became a favorite with painters, cloth makers, wallpaper designers, and dyers. It was widely used in industry, in children’s toys, and as a highly effective rat poison. The toxicity of dye made with emerald green was not recognized until the recipe was published in 1822. Manufacturers then changed the recipe, adding other ingredients to lighten the colour, and changing its name in an effort to disguise its poisonous nature. By 1871, arsenic production had increased to the point that Britain had become its largest producer and consumer and began shipping it to the United States for the making of pesticides. Amazingly, even with overwhelming scientific evidence of its highly toxic nature, production of emerald green was not banned until the 1960s.</p>
<p>1824: Metal workers had suffered for centuries from a paralysis similar to polio caused by the lead and arsenic in the metals they were working with. English scientist John Cooke observed: ‘The fumes from these metals, or the receptance of them in solution into the stomach, often causes paralysis.’</p>
<p>1890: Lead arsenate pesticide started to be sprayed in the US up to 12 times every summer to kill codling moth on apple crops.</p>
<p>1892: Polio outbreaks began to occur in Vermont, an apple growing region. In his report the Government Inspector Dr. Charles Caverly noted that parents reported that some children fell ill after eating fruit. He stated that ‘infantile paralysis usually occurred in families with more than one child, and as no efforts were made at isolation it was very certain it was non-contagious’ (with only one child in the family having been struck).</p>
<p>Note: Polio epidemics infected clusters of people in the exact same areas…suddenly and swiftly. These “polio” outbreaks were unusual, in that they hit throughout the summer. Parents reported finding their children paralyzed in and around apple orchards…one of the most heavily pesticide-sprayed crops of the time (with lead arsenate or copper arsenate).</p>
<p>1907: Calcium arsenate comes into use primarily on cotton crops.</p>
<p>1908: In a Massachusetts town with three cotton mills and apple orchards, 69 children suddenly fell ill with infantile paralysis.</p>
<p>1909: The UK bans apple imports from the States because of heavy lead arsenate residues.</p>
<p>1916: The New York City polio epidemic infected several thousand people and killed over two thousand. It was caused by a virulent strain of poliovirus that was engineered at the Rockefeller Laboratories and “accidentally” released into the public.</p>
<p>Note: For millennia, wild or naturally occurring poliovirus, was a common bowel inhabitant, generally causing no more than relatively mild gastrointestinal discomfort. Throughout history, polio had NO ability to spread from infected victims to the uninfected. In other words, polio was neither infectious nor contagious.</p>
<p>1921: Franklin D. Roosevelt became paralyzed overnight while on his farm…in the summer. His farm contained many crops, including apple orchards. He also swam the day prior in a bay that was polluted by industrial agricultural runoff.</p>
<p>1943: DDT is introduced, a neurotoxic pesticide. Over the next several years it comes into widespread use in American households. For example, wall paper impregnated with DDT was placed in children’s bedrooms. DDT became very popular as a means for combatting insect-borne human diseases. It was sprayed everywhere: in homes and gardens, and on adults and children. DDT has been linked to nervous system damage (including paralysis), cancer, as well as birth defects and reproductive problems.</p>
<p>1943: A polio epidemic in the UK town of Broadstairs, Kent is linked to a local dairy where cows were washed down with DDT.</p>
<p>1944: Albert Sabin reports that a major cause of sickness and death of American troops based in the Philippines was poliomyelitis. US military camps there were sprayed daily with DDT to kill mosquitoes. Neighboring Philippine settlements were not affected.</p>
<p>Note: Poliomyelitis is a term that describes spinal pathology involving inflammation in the spine. Paralytic poliomyelitis refers to diseases that cause paralysis, in either limbs or the respiratory system.</p>
<p>1944: NIH reports that DDT damages the same anterior horn cells that are damaged in infantile paralysis.</p>
<p>1946: Gebhaedt shows polio seasonality correlates with fruit harvest.</p>
<p>1949: Endocrinologist Dr Morton Biskind, a practitioner and medical researcher, found that DDT causes ‘lesions in the spinal cord similar to human polio.’</p>
<p>1950: US Public Health Industrial Hygiene Medical Director, J.G. Townsend, notes the similarity between parathion poisoning and polio and believes that some polio might be caused by eating fruits or vegetables with parathion residues.</p>
<p>1951: Dr. Ralph Scobey and Dr. Mortind Biskind testified in front of the U.S Congress that the paralysis around the country known as “polio” was caused by industrial poisons. Dr. Biskind presented evidence that pesticides were the major cause of polio epidemics. Dr. Scobey reported that he found clear evidence of poisoning when analyzing chemical traces in the blood of polio victims. They both testified that the “virus theory” was purposely fabricated by the chemical industry and the government to deflect litigation away from both parties.</p>
<p>Note: The viral causation theory was not something to be questioned. The careers of prominent virologists and health authorities were threatened. Biskind and Scobey’s ideas were subjected to ridicule.</p>
<p>1951: Dr. Biskind treats his polio patients as poisoning victims, removing toxins from food and environment, especially DDT contaminated milk and butter. Dr. Biskind writes: “Although young animals are more susceptible to the effects of DDT than adults, so far as the available literature is concerned, it does not appear that the effects of such concentrations on infants and children have even been considered.”</p>
<p>1949-1951: Doctors report success treating “polio” with antitoxins used to treat poisoning—dimercaprol and ascorbic acid. Example: Dr. F. R. Klenner reported: “In the poliomyelitis epidemic in North Carolina in 1948, 60 cases of this disease came under our care. The treatment was massive doses of vitamin C every two to four hours. Children up to four years received vitamin C injection intramuscularly. All patients were clinically well after 72 hours.”</p>
<p>1953: Clothes are moth-proofed by washing them in EQ-53, a formula containing DDT.</p>
<p>1953: Dr. Biskind writes: “It was known by 1945 that DDT was stored in the body fat of mammals and appears in their milk…yet far from admitting a causal relationship between DDT and polio that is so obvious, which in any other field of biology would be instantly accepted, virtually the entire apparatus of communication, lay and scientific alike, has been devoted to denying, concealing, suppressing, distorting and attempts to convert into its opposite this overwhelming evidence. Libel, slander, and economic boycott have not been overlooked in this campaign.”</p>
<p>1954: Legislation recognizing the dangers of persistent pesticides is enacted, and a phase out of DDT in the US accelerates along with a shift of sales of DDT to third world countries.</p>
<p>1955: The first polio vaccine was worked on by Dr. Jonas Salk, and human experiments using this vaccine were conducted purposely on orphans in government/church run institutions, because they were vulnerable and didn’t require any parental consent signatures. The vaccine was “declared safe” by “medicine” (as they always are) and that particular vaccine gave 40,000 orphans polio, permanently paralyzed hundreds and killed at least 10 children. All injuries and deaths, were, as usual, under-reported by the same authorities who orchestrated the atrocity. Historically, this atrocity is referred to as ‘The Cutter Incident.’ Cutter Laboratories was one of several companies that was recommended to be given a license by the United States government to produce Salk’s polio vaccine.</p>
<p>Note: DDT is phased out at the same time as widespread polio vaccinations begin. Polio cases skyrocket in communities that accept the polio vaccine, since the polio vaccine is laced with heavy metals and other toxins— Poisoning from lead, mercury and other heavy metals can manifest with lesions on neurological tissue. The toxins destroy the nerve/communication pathways connecting the brain to organs in the body. With the ramp-up in vaccination, the paralysis narrative starts all over again. As the polio vaccines cause huge spikes in polio, a misinformed public demands even more polio vaccine, and the cycle spirals skyward exponentially.</p>
<p>1956: The American Medical Association (AMA) mandated that all licensed medical doctors could no longer classify polio as polio. All polio diagnosis would be rejected in favor of Guillian-Barre Syndrome, AFP (acute flaccid paralysis), Bell’s Palsy, Cerebral Palsy, ALS, (Lou-Gehrig’s Disease), MS, MD etc. This sleight of hand was fabricated with the sole intent of giving the public the impression that the polio vaccine was successful at decreasing polio or eradicating polio. The public bought this hook, line and sinker and to this day, many pro vaccine arguments are ignited by the manufactured lie regarding the polio vaccine eradicating polio.</p>
<p>1955+: The new and “improved” polio vaccine was given to hundreds of millions of people, but heavy metals weren’t the only problem. The polio vaccine carried the Simian Virus 40 (SV40), as well as the AIDS virus—both monkey viruses. While we have all heard of AIDS, people are generally less familiar with SV40. SV40 has been found in several types of human cancers including brain, breast, colon, kidney and lung cancers. It is not clear how much of the rise in cancer rates being witnessed in the decades since polio vaccinations began is due to the vaccines, because no studies investigating the connection have ever been conducted.</p>
<p>Note: SV40, AIDS and other viruses got transferred to humans via vaccines due to the practice of cultivating viruses on monkey tissue. Monkeys are carriers of many viruses…one being Simian Virus 40 or SV40. When the intended or cultivated viruses were harvested from the monkey tissue, SV40 was also inadvertently harvested, and ended up in the vaccines. It is through this practice that the virus Dr. Michele Carbone dubbed the “perfect war machine,” ended up in human populations. SV40 was dubbed the “perfect war machine” due to the fact that it affects at least four cellular mechanisms that either promote cancer or interfere with the body’s ability to fight cancer.</p>
<p>1962: Rachel Carson’s ‘Silent Spring’ is published. Silent Spring documents the adverse environmental effects caused by the indiscriminate use of pesticides. In the book Carson accuses the chemical industry of spreading disinformation, and public officials of going along with the deceit.</p>
<p>1968: DDT registration cancelled for the US.</p>
<p>2008: Acute Flaccid Paralysis (AFP) is still raging in many parts of the world where pesticide use is high, and DDT is still used. AFP. MS, MD, Bell’s Palsy, cerebral palsy, ALS (Lou Gehrig’s Disease), Guillian-Barre are all catch-basket diagnoses, all similar in symptoms, tied to heavy metal poisoning and high toxic load.</p>
<p>2008: WHO states on its website: “There is no cure for polio. Its effects are irreversible.”</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>That polio vaccines are still crippling children around the world is nothing short of heartbreaking. It certainly warrants an investigation into vaccine mythology and the real agenda being executed against humanity involving science, chemicals, vaccines, the medical field in general, and the government. Sadly, instead of this happening, history may be repeating itself in 2020.</p>
