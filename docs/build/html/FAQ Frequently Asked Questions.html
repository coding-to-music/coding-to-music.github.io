<h2>What is issues with PCR testing and “cases”<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-issues-with-pcr-testing-and-cases" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>PCR “cases” indicates the presence of old inert remnants of inactive pieces of virus</p></li>
<li><p>The PCR test replicates, amplifies, multiplies the sample X times. 30-35 cyles is good, above will give lots of false postive “cases” - but they are false positive - if the PCR test was re-run at 28 or 30 it will likely be negative.</p></li>
<li><p>PCR testing has an interesting side effect in that the testing organization obtains your full DNA profile</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This is an excellent overview of the cases issue</p>
<p>“Case rate fallacy/false positive paradox” is derived from Bayes theorem. When the incidence of a disease in a population is low, unless the test used has very high specificity, more false positives will be determined than true positives. The difference in the numbers can be quite striking and certainly not inherently understandable.”</p>
