<h2>What do we know?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-do-we-know" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>A virus has been reported.  The virus affects mainly old, infirm, and those with comorbidities - the people who typically die of the flu.</li>
<li>The virus also appears to affect PoC more severely</li>
</ul>

<h2>What is issues with PCR testing and “cases”<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-issues-with-pcr-testing-and-cases" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>PCR “cases” indicates the presence of old inert remnants of inactive pieces of virus</li>
<li>The PCR test replicates, amplifies, multiplies the sample X times. 30-35 cyles is good, above will give lots of false postive “cases” - but they are false positive - if the PCR test was re-run at 28 or 30 it will likely be negative.</li>
<li>PCR testing has an interesting side effect in that the testing organization obtains your full DNA profile</li>
</ul>
<p>This is an excellent overview of the cases issue</p>
<p>“Case rate fallacy/false positive paradox” is derived from Bayes theorem. When the incidence of a disease in a population is low, unless the test used has very high specificity, more false positives will be determined than true positives. The difference in the numbers can be quite striking and certainly not inherently understandable.”</p>

<ul class="simple">
<li>The CDC last updated the data in 2018 - we have no data from 2019 or 2020 - no cause of death by age.</li>
<li>This is important because how will we know when the vaccines are effective?</li>
