<p>Ivermectin, the most promising COVID treatment to date, won its developers the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 2015 and a place on the World Health Organization’s Model List of Essential Medicines. Since the 1980s, with billions of doses given

<p>Cheap hair lice drug may cut the risk of hospitalised Covid patients dying by up to 80%, study finds
Ivermectin - which can cost as little as £1.50 per treatment- was also found to potentially halve the time those suffering from the virus were on the ward
Ivermectin was discovered in the 1970s and has fast become an essential medicine for a vast number of parasitic infections, such as head lice and scabies.</p>
<p>It is branded as Stromectol, an oral tablet for scabies and Soolantra, a skin cream for rosacea. It is branded as Sklice for treating head lice, which was approved in the US this year.</p>
<p>Today it is prescribed on the NHS and in the US for these conditions, but some scientists argue it could also be useful against Covid-19.

<p>MODE OF ACTION</p>
<p>Ivermectin is a member of the macrocylic lactone class of endectocides which have a unique mode of action. Compounds of the class bind selectively and with high affinity to glutamate-gated chloride ion channels which occur in invertebrate nerve and muscle cells.</p>
<p>This leads to an increase in the permeability of the cell membrane to chloride ions with hyperpolarization of the nerve or muscle cell, resulting in paralysis and death of the parasite. Compounds of this class may also interact with other ligand-gated chloride channels, such as those gated by the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA).</p>
<p>The margin of safety for compounds of this class is attributable to the fact that mammals do not have glutamate-gated chloride channels, the macrocyclic lactones have a low affinity for other mammalian ligand-gated chloride channels and they do not readily cross the blood-brain barrier.</p>
