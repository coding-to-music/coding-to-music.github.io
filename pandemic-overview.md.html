<h2> Purpose: Investigate the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic

<h1> Introduction  
- This site is full of opinion. We have collected a huge wide variety of items and we attempt to label these items as either True or False.   
- We document why it is our opinion, our group consensus, that these items are correctly tagged as either True or False.  
- Every item will be able to be tagged so you can either agree or disagree by you tagging the item yourself.   
- That feature is not yet ready but you can see we are attempting to make this a community-driven collective-knowledge resource.  
- This website will attempt to be kept up-to-date so you can learn what has changed since you last visited.

<h2> WHO official urges world leaders to stop using lockdowns as primary virus control method  
The World Health Organization’s special envoy on COVID-19 urged world leaders this week to stop “using lockdowns as your primary control method.”  
“We in the World Health Organization do not advocate lockdowns as the primary means of control of this virus,” Dr. David Nabarro said to The Spectator’s Andrew Neil. “The only time we believe a lockdown is justified is to buy you time to reorganize, regroup, rebalance your resources, protect your health workers who are exhausted, but by and large, we’d rather not do it.”

<h2> The WHO is recommending key changes to PCR testing.    
The WHO is recommending some changes to PCR testing.    

"PCR positive" is no longer a Covid "case"      

You are not Covid "case" now unless you get a second test to confirm it, and are presenting clinical symptoms.  
WHO guidance Diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2 states that careful interpretation of weak positive results is needed (1). The cycle threshold (Ct) needed to detect virus is inversely proportional to the patient’s viral load. Where test results do not correspond with the clinical presentation, a new specimen should be taken and retested using the same or different NAT technology.  

WHO reminds IVD users that **disease prevalence alters the predictive value of test results**; *as disease prevalence decreases, the risk of false positive increases (2). This means that the probability that a person who has a positive result (SARS-CoV-2 detected) is truly infected with SARS-CoV-2 decreases as prevalence decreases, irrespective of the claimed specificity.*

<h1> FAQ Frequently Asked Questions  
<h2> What do we know?  
- A virus has been reported.  The virus affects mainly old, infirm, and those with comorbidities - the people who typically die of the flu.  
- The virus also appears to affect PoC more severely  

<h2> What do we not know?  
- 
- 

<h2> What is issues with PCR testing and "cases"    
- PCR "cases" indicates the presence of old inert remnants of inactive pieces of virus  
- The PCR test replicates, amplifies, multiplies the sample X times. 30-35 cyles is good, above will give lots of false postive "cases" - but they are false positive - if the PCR test was re-run at 28 or 30 it will likely be negative.  
- PCR testing has an interesting side effect in that the testing organization obtains your full DNA profile  

This is an excellent overview of the cases issue:
"Case rate fallacy/false positive paradox" is derived from Bayes theorem. When the incidence of a disease in a population is low, unless the test used has very high specificity, more false positives will be determined than true positives. The difference in the numbers can be quite striking and certainly not inherently understandable."

<h2> What would a multi-year chart of "Deaths by Cause and Age" show us and where is that data?  
- The CDC last updated the data in 2018 - we have no data from 2019 or 2020 - no cause of death by age.
- This is important because how will we know when the vaccines are effective?
- Why is this simple data being withheld?

<h2> What are some simple questions that we think do not make any sense
- Old infirm w/ comorbidity are dying. So Why inject young healthy of reproductive age?  
- If the supermarket and many stores and business can be open, why not the library?  

<h2> What items do we consider true, and why?  
- It is completely unrealistic to believe a natural virus jumped out of a bush and caused this pandemic. This is a man-made virus.  
- 

<h2> What items do we consider false, and why?  
- The virus did not come from nature. It has too many advanced gain-of-function features that scientists recently proudly documented in published papers.

(Understanding the GitHub flow)[https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/]  
GitHub flow is a lightweight, branch-based workflow that supports teams and projects where deployments are made regularly  
  
This guide explains how and why GitHub flow works.  
  
- Main is deployable always  
- Create a branch & Commit work on it  
- Pull Request announces your work and opens discussion, even if you are nowhere near being ready to complete it
- Discussions are in the activity, full markup capability  
- @mentions to alert others  
- a bot can do housekeeping tasks such as trim old dead stale branches  
- Discuss and review changes, ensure testing and style are adhered to  
- Deploy to pre-prod or prod  
- Merge with main branch
